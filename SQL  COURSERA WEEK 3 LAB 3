**Problem:

Execute a working query using a sub-select to retrieve all employees records whose salary is lower than the average salary.

>>> select EMP_ID , F_NAME , L_NAME ,SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY<(SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES);


**Problem:

Execute a failing query (i.e. one which gives an error) to retrieve all employees records with EMP_ID, SALARY and maximum salary as MAX_SALARY in every row.

>>>select EMP_ID, SALARY, MAX(SALARY) AS MAX_SALARY 
from employees; 



**Problem:

Execute a Column Expression that retrieves all employees records with EMP_ID, SALARY and maximum salary as MAX_SALARY in every row.

>>>select EMP_ID, SALARY, ( select MAX(SALARY) from employees ) AS MAX_SALARY 
from employees;

**Problem:

Execute a Table Expression for the EMPLOYEES table that excludes columns with sensitive employee data (i.e. does not include columns: SSN, B_DATE, SEX, ADDRESS, SALARY).

>>select * from ( select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID from employees) AS EMP4ALL;
